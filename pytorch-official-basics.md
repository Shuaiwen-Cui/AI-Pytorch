## Learn the Basics

Most machine learning workflows involve working with data, creating models, optimizing model parameters, and saving the trained models. This tutorial introduces you to a complete ML workflow implemented in PyTorch, with links to learn more about each of these concepts.

We’ll use the FashionMNIST dataset to train a neural network that predicts if an input image belongs to one of the following classes: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, or Ankle boot.

This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Python and Deep Learning concepts.
